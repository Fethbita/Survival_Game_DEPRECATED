Health of the player can be very bad, bad, average, good and very good. We can turn this into a bar as well.

There will be two phases of a day. Daytime and nighttime. You can choose to do only 2 actions in one phase.

**Daytime:** Can explore without needing a torch.

**Nighttime:** Can be attacked by wolves or other unfriendly animals. Exploring can be done with a torch but not effective.

## Actions That Can Be Done in Phases:

**Exploring:** You look for things or places to go. This is going to be one of the first things you are able to do. Rarely you find relics.

**Look for food:** Look for things to eat. Hunting?

**Pick up things:** Twigs, small rocks etc.

**Mining:** You try to get some rock. Without tools this is not possible to do.

- Some things cannot be done in the night time. Like exploring. Unless you have a torch.

- New places can be explored. Their types and things you can find in those places can differ.

- Background will be changing according to the phase of a day.

- Protagonist has to eat every day.

- We might want to add a little bit story for players to feel connected to the game. Otherwise, they might feel bored too quickly. This story could be separated into little pieces of information that can be found from relics or other stuff inside places. Also we can give information about the character 0every now and then. Maybe everyday, like a diary.

- Protagonist will see some stuff that will eventually lead a story. White wolf.

- Possibility of sudden death. The chance of dying will reduce if you have something to protect yourself.

- If it's an endless game it might be a good idea to include a leader board. Else after the ending, an endless mode might be unlocked.

- Diary is a good idea, but it has to be short for convenience. Convenience meaning; it shouldn't be a page long 10 font text. Each page might be 10 20 lines at most, 15 font and easy to understand. But since the game is very random, it might be hard to write the script. Have to think about it.
