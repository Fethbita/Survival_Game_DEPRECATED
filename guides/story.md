I am in the middle of nowhere. My head is killing me and I cannot find my phone. I was sure I put it in my pocket. Not that I had a signal, but it would be nice to have it with me.

If I ignore the voices inside my head, the only thing I hear is the song of birds. It just gives me hope that the sun is up and shining. The last thing I remember is that I was at home watching a tv series in my bed. I cannot remember what happened after that, but I found myself waking up in this forest. After I woke up, I walked a couple of hours, however, there is nothing but trees and grass. I don't know why I am here or what happened, but if I don't want to stay in the darkness I need to find some stuff to make fire with. I better start searching.

I was able to find some stuff. Now I only have one purpose. Yes. I need to figure out how to get rid of this place and go to my family. Did I tell you that I have two kids and a beautiful wife? You should see her eyes. They are just as bright as the sun. God, I started talking to myself now. Great! Okay, breathe Jason. Calm down. You know already know that there is always hope.

Let's start with some small steps. I don't have much time to think right now. Looking at the sun's position, I need to find a way to make fire.
