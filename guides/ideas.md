## Some other ideas

* Some things cannot be done in the night time. Like exploring. Unless you have a torch.
* New places can be explored. Their types and things you can find in those places can differ.
* Background will be changing according to the phase of a day.
* Protagonist has to eat every day.
* We might want to add a little bit story for players to feel connected to the game. Otherwise, they might feel bored too quickly. This story could be separated into little pieces of information that can be found from relics or other stuff inside places. Also we can give information about the character every now and then. Maybe everyday, like a diary.
* Protagonist will see some stuff that will eventually lead a story. White wolf.
* Possibility of sudden death. The chance of dying will reduce if you have something to protect yourself.
* If it's an endless game it might be a good idea to include a leader board. Else after the ending, an endless mode might be unlocked.
* Diary is a good idea, but it has to be short for convenience. Convenience meaning; it shouldn't be a page long 10 font text. Each page might be 10 20 lines at most, 15 font and easy to understand. But since the game is very random, it might be hard to write the script. Have to think about it.
* Player should be able to choose to attack or run away when facing an animal before the turn starts. Even if he chooses to attack that doesn't mean that he is 100% going to see an animal. Just choosing what to do if that happens.
* Player should be noticed how many moves he's got left. Like when one of the buttons pushed, maybe a screen popup can say one more action can be chosen.
* Instead directly processing the chosen two things we will have a button for player to say "I am done. Process it." This button will not be active at first, but when two actions are selected it will become active.

**_Thoughts about the design that will be implemented later. Some changes can be applied or they can be discarded entirely. I am kind of taking notes._**

On the left side, there will be a list of things to craft. After crafting something, it will change color. Right side will be logs and inventory. We basically want a simple main screen. Also we need to inform the player about the important stuff in the main screen, like if he doesn't have a campfire, he needs to be warned. We need to inform player about the findings after every phase as well, but the main logs and the story will be kept in the right pane.
