**Name of our game** - I am thinking about the story for now, it should be something according to the story. 

~~Health of the player can be very bad, bad, average, good and very good. We can turn this into a bar as well.~~
We took care of this with a bar for now.

There will be two phases of a day. Daytime and nighttime. You can choose to do only two actions in one phase.

## Daytime

**Characteristics**
* Player is able to explore without a torch.


## Nighttime

**Characteristics**
* Player can be attacked by wolves or other unfriendly animals even when resting. 
* Exploring can be done with a torch but not effective.

**Equipping Items**
Player can only equip two tools. When the player wears a backpack, he can equip 2 more items.

**Durability of Items**
When an item is used, axe for example, it will lose durability. With an axe the player can only gather 10 woods.

## Actions That Can Be Done in Phases:

### Explore: You look for things or places to go. This is going to be one of the first things you are able to do. Rarely you find relics.

**What does explore button do?**

* Possibility of finding new places. - _For this, I now have this feeling that we shouldn't create many random places to go. Instead we should have a couple of places to go according to our storyline, that's why we should make them hard to find for the sake of playtime._
* Possibility of finding interesting stuff related to the story.
* Possibility of finding something that is already made. Like an axe.

### Pick Up: Twigs, small rocks etc. (I am not happy with the naming of this)

**What does pick up button do?**

* You find stuff that are necessary to build things. Also when you have an equipped tool, you start to gather extra stuff. For instance, if you have an axe with you, you start to gather wood with every phase you go for picking up things. 
* Possibility of finding berries.
* Possibility of finding flowers.
* Possibility of finding mushrooms.

~~**Mine:** You try to get some rock. Without tools this is not possible to do.~~ (This will probably be discarded)

### Craft: You craft stuff that are necessary to survive. This is probably not going to be a button but a page.

**What can be crafted?**

Tools:
* Axe - Used for gathering wood.
    * Requirements = 1 Stone, 2 Branch, 1 Fiber
    * Durability = 10 Woods
* Spear - Used for killing animals.
    * Requirements = 2 Stone, 2 Branch, 2 Fiber
    * Durability = Contact with 4 animals.

    * Requirements = 1 Stone, 1 Branch, 1 Fiber
    * Durability = Contact with 4 animals.

    * Requirements = 1 Branch, 1 Bee Wax
    * Durability = 1 travel at night. 
* Trap - Used for catching animals.
    * Requirements = 3 Branch, 2 Leaf
    * Durability = 5 animals
* Outfit - Resistance to animal attacks.
    * Requirements = 3 Branch, 2 Fiber, 3 Wood
    * Durability = 5 animal attacks.
* Campfire - Increases chance of animal attack %10, but keeps the player warm. 
    * Requirements = 3 Stone, 3 Woods, 1 Bee Wax
    * Durability = 2 nights
* Shelter - Decreases chance of animal attack 20%.
    * Requirements = 5 Wood, 5 Branch, 1 Shaped Stone _(Created with 2 Stones and 2 Branches)_
    * Durability = 5 nights
* Backpack - 2 more items can be equipped.
    * Requirements = 4 Branch, 2 Fibers
    * Durability = 10 Travels. - _We will put a percantage on the main screen so the player will know about the durability of the bag. If durability finishes on the journey, half of the collected stuff will be lost._
* Cooking Pot - Requires campfire and is used for cooking animals.
    * Requirements = 2 Shaped Stone, 3 Wood
    * Durability = 6 cooking.

We need to categorize them as "tools", "survival" etc. but if we don't have many things to categorize, then we can leave it be.

**Hunting:** This option will probably be active after the player makes a spear. For now, we have no further information.

## Unanswered Questions:

*  Most important question is why would anyone want to play our game?
*  ~~Does the protagonist have a story?~~ - Yes, but at the same time we don't want to easily end the game. It should either take many hours or continue forever with the small stories it has inside it. I need ideas here. Only yours.
*  How does the game end? Or will it end at all?
*  What are the relics that can be found during exploration?
*  Is cooking possible?
