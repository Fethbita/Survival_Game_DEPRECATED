**Name of our game** - I am thinking about the story for now, it should be something according to the story.

Health and energy bar will be at the top of the screen.

There will be two phases of a day. Daytime and nighttime. You can choose to do only two actions in one phase.

## Daytime

**Characteristics**
* Player is able to explore without a torch.
* Either it is daytime or nighttime

## Nighttime

**Characteristics**
* Player can be attacked by wolves or other unfriendly animals even when resting.
* Exploring can be done with a torch but not effective.

## Items

Player can only equip two tools. When the player wears a backpack, he can equip 2 more items. Almost every item will have durability to make the gameplay more challenging.

---

## Animals

They will have health and they are considered to be armorless.

**Unfriendly Animals**
* Wolf - 8 Hit Point - Damage 200 Hit Points
* Snake - 4 Hit Point - Damage 100 Hit Points - Getting poisoned with 20% chance
* Bear - 20 Hit Point - Damage 400 Hit Points

**Neutral Animals**
* Bee - They cannot be cultivated or killed. From their hive, bee wax and honey can be gathered.
* Rabbit - 2 Hit Point - Don't fight back.
* Turtle - 1 Hit Point - Don't fight back.

## Raw Materials

* Stone
* Branch
* Beeswax
* Leaf

## Actions That Can Be Done in Phases:

### Explore: You look for things or places to go. This is going to be one of the first things you are able to do. Rarely you find relics.

**What does explore button do?**

* Possibility of finding new places. - _For this, I now have this feeling that we shouldn't create many random places to go. Instead we should have a couple of places to go according to our storyline, that's why we should make them hard to find for the sake of playtime._
* Possibility of finding interesting stuff related to the story.
* Possibility of finding something that is already made. Like an axe.

### Pick Up: Twigs, small rocks etc. (I am not happy with the naming of this)

**What does pick up button do?**

* You find stuff that are necessary to build things. Also when you have an equipped tool, you start to gather extra stuff. For instance, if you have an axe with you, you start to gather wood with every phase you go for picking up things.
* Possibility of finding berries.
* Possibility of finding flowers.
* Possibility of finding mushrooms.

### Craft: You craft stuff that are necessary to survive. This is probably not going to be a button but a page.

**What can be crafted?**

* Axe - Used for gathering wood.
    * Requirements = 1 Stone, 2 Branch, 1 Fiber

    * Durability = 5 nights

    * Requirements = 4 Branch, 2 Fibers
    * Durability = 10 Travels. - _We will put a percentage on the main screen so the player will know about the durability of the bag. If durability finishes on the journey, half of the collected stuff will be lost._
* Cooking Pot - Requires campfire and is used for cooking animals.
    * Requirements = 2 Shaped Stone, 3 Wood
    * Durability = 6 cooking.

We need to categorize them as "tools", "survival" etc. but if we don't have many things to categorize, then we can leave it be.

**Hunting:** This option will probably be active after the player makes a spear. For now, we have no further information.

## Unanswered Questions:

*  Most important question is why would anyone want to play our game?
*  ~~Does the protagonist have a story?~~ - Yes, but at the same time we don't want to easily end the game. It should either take many hours or continue forever with the small stories it has inside it. I need ideas here. Only yours.
*  How does the game end? Or will it end at all?
*  What are the relics that can be found during exploration?
*  Is cooking possible?
