## Status Unknown

The name of the game. It is related to the story. Protagonist has no idea how he got lost, nor does he know his status. He is having a memory loss, but in time he will start to remember some things or not. It will be decided according to the storyline. He actually doesn't lose memories, he just doesn't remember what he is doing sometimes. This is called a fugue state. This will give us the chance to use a lot of surprising events within the story.

Health and energy bar will be at the top of the screen.

There will be two phases of a day. Daytime and nighttime. You can choose to do only two actions in one phase.

There is a chance eating berries or mushrooms gets you

## Actions That Can Be Done in Phases:

### Explore: You look for things or places to go. This is going to be one of the first things you are able to do. Rarely you find relics.

**What does explore button do?**

* Possibility of finding new places. - _For this, I now have this feeling that we shouldn't create many random places to go. Instead we should have a couple of places to go according to our storyline, that's why we should make them hard to find for the sake of playtime._ For example, we could increase this chance from 1% to 10% every day and stop increasing it.
* Possibility of finding interesting stuff related to the story.
* Possibility of finding something that is already made. Like an axe. For now, let's say 5%.

### Search: Twigs, small rocks etc.

**What does search button do?**

* You find stuff that are necessary to build things. Also when you have an equipped tool, you start to gather extra stuff. For instance, if you have an axe with you, you start to gather wood with every phase you go for picking up things.
* Possibility of finding berries.
* Possibility of finding flowers.
* Possibility of finding mushrooms.

### Craft: You craft stuff that are necessary to survive. This is probably not going to be a button but a page.

## Unanswered Questions:

*  Most important question is why would anyone want to play our game?
*  ~~Does the protagonist have a story?~~ - Yes, but at the same time we don't want to easily end the game. It should either take many hours or continue forever with the small stories it has inside it. I need ideas here. Only yours.
*  How does the game end? Or will it end at all?
*  What are the relics that can be found during exploration?
*  Is cooking possible?
