**Name of our game** - I am thinking about the story for now, it should be something according to the story. 

~~Health of the player can be very bad, bad, average, good and very good. We can turn this into a bar as well.~~
We took care of this with a bar for now.

There will be two phases of a day. Daytime and nighttime. You can choose to do only two actions in one phase.

**Daytime:** Can explore without needing a torch.

**Nighttime:** Can be attacked by wolves or other unfriendly animals. Exploring can be done with a torch but not effective.

**Equipping Items**
Player can only equip two tools. When the player wears a backpack, he can equip 2 more items.

---

## Actions That Can Be Done in Phases:

### Explore: You look for things or places to go. This is going to be one of the first things you are able to do. Rarely you find relics.

**What does explore button do?**

* Possibility of finding new places. - _For this, I now have this feeling that we shouldn't create many random places to go. Instead we should have a couple of places to go according to our storyline, that's why we should make them hard to find for the sake of playtime._
* Possibility of finding interesting stuff related to the story.
* Possibility of finding something that is already made. Like an axe.

### Pick Up: Twigs, small rocks etc. (I am not happy with the naming of this)

**What does pick up button do?**

* You find stuff that are necessary to build things. Also when you have an equipped tool, you start to gather extra stuff. For instance, if you have an axe with you, you start to gather wood with every phase you go for picking up things. 
* Possibility of finding berries.
* Possibility of finding flowers.
* Possibility of finding mushrooms.

~~**Mine:** You try to get some rock. Without tools this is not possible to do.~~ (This will probably get discarded)

### Craft: You craft stuff that are necessary to survive. This is probably not going to be a button but a page.

**What can be crafted?**

Tools:
* Axe 
* Spear
* Fishing rod
* Torch
* Trap
* Campfire
* Tent
* Backpack

Requirements to do these items?

We need to categorize them as "tools", "survival" etc. but if we don't have many things to categorize, then we can leave it be.

**Hunting:** This option will probably be active after the player makes a spear. For now, we have no further information.

**Some other stuff**

* Some things cannot be done in the night time. Like exploring. Unless you have a torch.
* New places can be explored. Their types and things you can find in those places can differ.
* Background will be changing according to the phase of a day.
* Protagonist has to eat every day.
* We might want to add a little bit story for players to feel connected to the game. Otherwise, they might feel bored too quickly. This story could be separated into little pieces of information that can be found from relics or other stuff inside places. Also we can give information about the character every now and then. Maybe everyday, like a diary.
* Protagonist will see some stuff that will eventually lead a story. White wolf.
* Possibility of sudden death. The chance of dying will reduce if you have something to protect yourself.
* If it's an endless game it might be a good idea to include a leader board. Else after the ending, an endless mode might be unlocked.
* Diary is a good idea, but it has to be short for convenience. Convenience meaning; it shouldn't be a page long 10 font text. Each page might be 10 20 lines at most, 15 font and easy to understand. But since the game is very random, it might be hard to write the script. Have to think about it.

## Unanswered Questions:

*  Most important question is why would anyone want to play our game?
*  ~~Does the protagonist have a story?~~ - Yes, but at the same time we don't want to easily end the game. It should either take many hours or continue forever with the small stories it has inside it. I need ideas here. Only yours.
*  How does the game end? Or will it end at all?
*  What are the relics that can be found during exploration?
*  Is cooking possible?


_Thinkings about the design that will be implemented later. Some changes can be applied or they can be discarded entirely. I am kind of taking notes._

On the left side, there will be a list of things to craft. After crafting something, it will change color. Right side will be logs and inventory. We basically want a simple main screen. Also we need to inform the player about the important stuff in the main screen, like if he doesn't have a campfire, he needs to be warned. We need to inform player about the findings after every phase as well, but the main logs and the story will be kept in the right pane.
