**Name of our game** - I am thinking about the story for now, it should be something according to the story. 

~~Health of the player can be very bad, bad, average, good and very good. We can turn this into a bar as well.~~
We took care of this with a bar for now.

There will be two phases of a day. Daytime and nighttime. You can choose to do only two actions in one phase.

**Daytime:** Can explore without needing a torch.

**Nighttime:** Can be attacked by wolves or other unfriendly animals. Exploring can be done with a torch but not effective.

**Equipping Items**
Player can only equip two tools. When the player wears a backpack, he can equip 2 more items.

## Actions That Can Be Done in Phases:

### Explore: You look for things or places to go. This is going to be one of the first things you are able to do. Rarely you find relics.

**What does explore button do?**

* Possibility of finding new places. - _For this, I now have this feeling that we shouldn't create many random places to go. Instead we should have a couple of places to go according to our storyline, that's why we should make them hard to find for the sake of playtime._
* Possibility of finding interesting stuff related to the story.
* Possibility of finding something that is already made. Like an axe.

### Pick Up: Twigs, small rocks etc. (I am not happy with the naming of this)

**What does pick up button do?**

* You find stuff that are necessary to build things. Also when you have an equipped tool, you start to gather extra stuff. For instance, if you have an axe with you, you start to gather wood with every phase you go for picking up things. 
* Possibility of finding berries.
* Possibility of finding flowers.
* Possibility of finding mushrooms.

~~**Mine:** You try to get some rock. Without tools this is not possible to do.~~ (This will probably be discarded)

### Craft: You craft stuff that are necessary to survive. This is probably not going to be a button but a page.

**What can be crafted?**

Tools:
* Axe 
* Spear
* Fishing rod
* Torch
* Trap
* Campfire
* Tent
* Backpack

Requirements to do these items?

We need to categorize them as "tools", "survival" etc. but if we don't have many things to categorize, then we can leave it be.

**Hunting:** This option will probably be active after the player makes a spear. For now, we have no further information.

## Unanswered Questions:

*  Most important question is why would anyone want to play our game?
*  ~~Does the protagonist have a story?~~ - Yes, but at the same time we don't want to easily end the game. It should either take many hours or continue forever with the small stories it has inside it. I need ideas here. Only yours.
*  How does the game end? Or will it end at all?
*  What are the relics that can be found during exploration?
*  Is cooking possible?
