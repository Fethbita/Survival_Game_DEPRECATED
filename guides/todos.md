**High priority**
- [x] Update mechanics.md (This is an example)
- [x] Make width of the objects relative to screen width.
- [x] We need to add pages which can be seen in navigation.jpg in guides folder.
- [x] Also at the bottom, there needs to be an indicator to understand which page we are on which can be seen in navigation2.jpg.
- [ ] Every phase needs to give information to us about the findings with the Logs screen. This could take 3 seconds as we don't want to move too quickly, but we also don't want to bore the player so, we don't want to make it more.

**Low priority**
- [x] Make energy and health bar more smoother with transitions
- [ ] Exploring cannot be done at night without a torch. For this we need to implement equipping system.
