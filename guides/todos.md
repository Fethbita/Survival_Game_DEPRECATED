**High priority**
- [x] Update mechanics.md (This is an example)
- [ ] We need to add pages which can be seen in navigation.jpg in guides folder. Also at the bottom, there needs to be an indicator to understand which page we are on which can be seen in navigation2.jpg.
- [ ] Every phase needs to give information to us about the findings with the Logs screen. This could take 3 seconds as we don't want to move too quickly, but we also don't want to bore the player so, we don't want to make it more.
- [ ] Exploring cannot be done at night without a torch. For this we need to implement equipping system.

**Low priority**
- [ ] Make energy and health bar more smoother with transitions
