**High priority**
- [x] Update mechanics.md (This is an example)
- [ ] Every phase needs to give information to us about the findings with the Logs screen. This could take 3 seconds as we don't want to move too quickly, but we also don't want to bore the player so, we don't want to make it more.
- [ ] Exploring cannot be done at night without a torch. For this we need to implement equipping system.

**Low priority**
- [ ] Make enery and health bar more smoother with transitions
